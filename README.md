Hi! My name is Fawzān Bilāl, but you can call me Fawzib-dev — because I love coding! 
I'm passionate about building cool things with code and AI. Whether it's web development, educational tools, or creative automations, I'm always learning and experimenting with new tech.

- Sharing knowledge through educational projects
- Making responsive and smart websites with Next.js and Tailwind CSS

I'm Currently Learning:

Tech Stack:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

- AI platforms (like ChatGPT!)

Fun Fact:
I’m designing NovaCalc – an AI-powered calculator that understands natural language, solves math problems, and explains the answers!
